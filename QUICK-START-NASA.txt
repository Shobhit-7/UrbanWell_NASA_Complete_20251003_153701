🌍 UrbanWell NASA API - Quick Start Guide
=========================================
Team: Decoders (Shobhit Shukla & Charu Awasthi)
NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

🚀 SUPER QUICK START (4 steps):

1. GET NASA ACCOUNT (FREE - 2 minutes):
   → Go to: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/
   → Register with your email
   → Verify email and remember username/password

2. CONFIGURE CREDENTIALS:
   → Copy ".env.template" to ".env"
   → Edit .env and add your NASA username/password:
     NASA_EARTHDATA_USERNAME=your_actual_username
     NASA_EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=your_actual_password

3. INSTALL REQUIREMENTS:
   → pip install -r requirements.txt
   → (This installs Flask + NASA libraries)

4. RUN APPLICATION:
   → python urbanwell_nasa_backend.py
   → Open: http://localhost:5000/dashboard.html

🎉 YOU'RE NOW USING REAL NASA SATELLITE DATA!

📊 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
✅ Real-time air quality from TEMPO satellite
✅ Atmospheric data from OMI/Aura satellite  
✅ Groundwater changes from GRACE satellites
✅ Vegetation health from MODIS satellite
✅ High-resolution data from Landsat satellites
✅ Interactive dashboard with 6 sample cities
✅ Admin panel to add your own cities worldwide

🔍 HOW TO VERIFY REAL NASA DATA:
1. Check console output for "✅ NASA authentication successful"
2. Look for "NASA_TEMPO_OMI" in data source labels (not "SIMULATION")
3. Visit admin panel - should show "✅ Connected" for NASA APIs
4. Add your own city and see fresh satellite data

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: "NASA authentication failed"
Solution: Double-check username/password at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/

Problem: "earthaccess module not found"
Solution: pip install earthaccess (or pip install -r requirements.txt)

Problem: Shows "SIMULATION" instead of NASA data
Solution: NASA servers may be temporarily down - this is normal fallback

Problem: Port 5000 in use
Solution: Edit urbanwell_nasa_backend.py line 571, change port to 8080

Problem: GDAL errors on Linux
Solution: sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev

🌍 NASA API INTEGRATION DETAILS:

WHERE YOUR CREDENTIALS ARE USED:
→ Line 15-25: Loading from .env file
→ Line 35-55: NASA authentication setup  
→ Line 60-75: earthaccess.login() with your credentials
→ Line 85-200: Real API calls to NASA data centers

REAL NASA DATASETS ACCESSED:
→ TEMPO: North American air quality (hourly updates)
→ OMI/Aura: Global atmospheric composition (daily)  
→ GRACE: Global groundwater storage (monthly)
→ MODIS: Global vegetation indices (16-day composites)
→ Landsat: High-resolution land surface (16-day revisit)

API ENDPOINTS USED:
→ NASA Earthdata Login: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/
→ NASA Data Centers: Direct satellite data access
→ NASA API Gateway: https://api.nasa.gov/ (optional)

📁 FILES INCLUDED:
• urbanwell_nasa_backend.py - Main app with NASA integration
• .env.template - Credentials configuration template
• requirements.txt - All NASA libraries (earthaccess, etc.)
• dashboard.html - Interactive frontend
• NASA-SETUP-GUIDE.md - Complete setup documentation
• check-nasa-installation.py - System verification tool

🏆 COMPETITION ADVANTAGES:
✅ REAL NASA DATA - Not simulated, actual satellite measurements
✅ GLOBAL COVERAGE - Works for any city worldwide
✅ REAL-TIME UPDATES - Fresh data from NASA's operational satellites  
✅ COMPREHENSIVE - Air quality + water + vegetation combined
✅ PROFESSIONAL GRADE - Same data NASA scientists use
✅ SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE - Production-ready for deployment

🎯 DEMO TIPS:
1. Start with included cities (Delhi, Mumbai, etc.)
2. Show real-time NASA data indicators  
3. Add a new city (Paris, New York, etc.) to show global capability
4. Explain how each satellite provides different urban health insights
5. Highlight real-world applications for city planners

📞 SUPPORT:
→ NASA Earthdata Help: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/support
→ Installation Issues: Run "python check-nasa-installation.py"  
→ Setup Questions: Read NASA-SETUP-GUIDE.md
→ API Status: Visit http://localhost:5000/admin after startup

🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS:
After setup, you should see:
✅ Console: "NASA Earthdata authentication successful"
✅ Dashboard: Data sources showing "NASA_TEMPO_OMI" etc.
✅ Admin Panel: "✅ Connected" for NASA API status
✅ Fresh satellite data for any city you add

🌍 YOU'RE NOW PART OF NASA'S EARTH OBSERVATION NETWORK!

Your UrbanWell system accesses the same satellites that monitor Earth's 
atmosphere, land, and water for climate science and environmental research.

Perfect for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025!
